# Termigram
Termigram is telegram client in linux terminal style powered by node.js.

For what?
For me - to learn js. 
For others - to make their own clients based on this, possible already with a graphical shell.

# Installation
1. Install node.js.
2. Download files from the repository.
3. Enter your api id and api hash in config.json.
4. Open using *node index.js* in console.
5. Done!
